Foster international cooperation to address global aspects of the problem. The 2007 Kangaroo Island bushfires were a series of bushfires caused by lightning strikes on 6 December 2007 on Kangaroo Island, South Australia, resulting in the destruction of 95,000 hectares (230,000 acres) of national park and wilderness protection area. Many fires are as a result of either deliberate arson or carelessness, however these fires normally happen in readily accessible areas and are rapidly brought under control. Man-made events include arcing from overhead power lines, arson, accidental ignition in the course of agricultural clearing, grinding and welding activities, campfires, cigarettes and dropped matches, sparks from machinery, and controlled burn escapes. The fires would have been caused by both natural phenomenon and human hands. A summer heat wave in Victoria, Australia, created conditions which fuelled the massive bushfires in 2009.

Climate sensitivity is an emergent property of these models. The cause of the increased sensitivity lies mainly in improved modelling of clouds so that low clouds descrease more strongly when temperature rise causing enhanced planetary absorption of sunlight. The more sensitive a climate system is to increased greenhouse gases, the more likely it is to have decades when temperatures are much higher or much lower than the longer-term average. Climate sensitivity is typically estimated in three ways; by using observations taken during the industrial age, by using temperature and other data from the Earth's past and by modelling the climate system in computers.

Scientists have identified many episodes of climate change during Earth's geological history; more recently since the industrial revolution the climate has increasingly been affected by human activities driving global warming, and the terms are commonly used interchangeably in that context. In the scientific literature, there is an overwhelming consensus that global surface temperatures have increased in recent decades and that the trend is caused mainly by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases. Decades of scientific research have shown that climate can change from both natural and anthropogenic causes. Catastrophic effects in 50\u2013100 years would likely be observed according to 41%, while 44% thought the effects would be moderate and about 13 percent saw relatively little danger.

Models referenced by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) predict that global temperatures are likely to increase by 1.1 to 6.4\u00a0\u00b0C (2.0 to 11.5\u00a0\u00b0F) between 1990 and 2100. The observed increase in hurricane intensity is larger than climate models predict for the sea surface temperature changes we have experienced. They judge that global mean surface air temperature has increased by 0.3 to 0.6\u00a0\u00b0C over the last 100 years, broadly consistent with prediction of climate models, but also of the same magnitude as natural climate variability. Projections based on the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios suggest warming over the 21st century at a more rapid rate than that experienced for at least the last 10,000 years. The finished report summarizes the findings of scientists, showing that maintaining a temperature rise to below 1.5\u00a0\u00b0C remains possible, but only through \"rapid and far-reaching transitions in energy, land, urban and infrastructure..., and industrial systems\".

This is the case for CO 2, which is reduced by photosynthesis of plants, and which, after dissolving in the oceans, reacts to form carbonic acid and bicarbonate and carbonate ions (see ocean acidification). With the production of CO2 from the burning of fossil fuels, oceans are becoming more acidic since CO2 dissolves in water and forms the acidic bicarbonate ion. For example, the elevated oceanic levels of CO 2 may produce CO 2-induced acidification of body fluids, known as hypercapnia.

Increasing acidity is thought to have a range of potentially harmful consequences for marine organisms such as depressing metabolic rates and immune responses in some organisms and causing coral bleaching. Calcium carbonate also becomes more soluble at lower pH, so ocean acidification is likely to have profound effects on marine organisms with calcareous shells, such as oysters, clams, sea urchins, and corals, because their ability to form shells will be reduced, and the carbonate compensation depth will rise closer to the sea surface.

Foster international cooperation to address global aspects of the problem. Tropical deforestation is responsible for approximately 20% of world greenhouse gas emissions. Of these emissions, 65% was carbon dioxide from fossil fuel burning and industry, 11% was carbon dioxide from land use change, which is primarily due to deforestation, 16% was from methane, 6.2% was from nitrous oxide, and 2.0% was from fluorinated gases. Land-use change, such as deforestation, caused about 31% of cumulative emissions over 1870\u20132017, coal 32%, oil 25%, and gas 10%. The estimate of total CO 2 emissions includes biotic carbon emissions, mainly from deforestation. The vast majority of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions come from combustion of fossil fuels, principally coal, oil, and natural gas, with additional contributions coming from deforestation, changes in land use, soil erosion and agriculture (including livestock).

Global warming and climate change are often used interchangeably. Research in the 1950s suggested that temperatures were increasing, and a 1952 newspaper used the term \"climate change\". Both the terms global warming and climate change were used only occasionally until 1975, when Wallace Smith Broecker published a scientific paper on the topic, \"Climatic Change: Are We on the Brink of a Pronounced Global Warming?\". In technical sources, the term climate change is also used to refer to past and future climate changes that persist for and extended period of time, and includes regional changes as well as global change. NOAA, 17 June 2015; IPCC AR5 SYR Glossary 2014, p.\u00a0120: \"Climate change refers to a change in the state of the climate that can be identified (e.g., by using statistical tests) by changes in the mean and/or the variability of its properties and that persists for an extended period, typically decades or longer.

Following Le Chatelier's principle, the chemical equilibrium of the Earth's carbon cycle will shift in response to anthropogenic CO2 emissions. It is a major aspect of climate change and has been demonstrated by direct temperature measurements and by measurements of various effects of the warming. In 1896, he published the first climate model of its kind, showing that halving of CO 2 could have produced the drop in temperature initiating the ice age. Scientists have determined that the major factors causing the current climate change are greenhouse gases, land use changes, and aerosols and soot. Models are typically used when it is either impossible or impractical to create experimental conditions in which scientists can directly measure outcomes.

Even in the areas with relatively low levels of air pollution, public health effects can be significant and costly, since a large number of people breathe in such pollutants. Fossil fuel prices generally are below their actual costs, or their \"efficient prices,\" when economic externalities, such as the costs of air pollution and global climate destruction, are taken into account. Artificial gasolines and other renewable energy sources currently require more expensive production and processing technologies than conventional petroleum reserves, but may become economically viable in the near future. Today's primary sources of energy are mainly non-renewable: natural gas, oil, coal, peat, and conventional nuclear power. It would also reduce environmental pollution such as air pollution caused by burning of fossil fuels and improve public health, reduce premature mortalities due to pollution and save associated health costs that amount to several hundred billion dollars annually only in the United States.

Land use change (mainly deforestation in the tropics) account for up to one third of total anthropogenic CO 2 emissions. The trucking and haulage industry plays a part in production of CO 2, contributing around 20% of the UK's total carbon emissions a year, with only the energy industry having a larger impact at around 39%. Total anthropogenic emissions at the end of 2009 were estimated at 49.5 gigatonnes CO 2-equivalent. Cumulative anthropogenic (i.e., human-emitted) emissions of CO 2 from fossil fuel use are a major cause of global warming, and give some indication of which countries have contributed most to human-induced climate change. The vast majority of anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions come from combustion of fossil fuels, principally coal, oil, and natural gas, with additional contributions coming from deforestation, changes in land use, soil erosion and agriculture (including livestock).

Various studies in the 1990s, and an economic analysis by Statistics Norway, have estimated the effect of the CO2 tax to be a reduction of 2.5\u201311% of Norwegian emissions under a business-as-usual approach (i.e., the predicted emissions that would have occurred without the tax). An Economic Assessment of Policy Instruments for Combating Climate Change. This is considered as a particularly difficult policy proposal as the economic growth of developing countries are proportionally reflected in the growth of greenhouse emissions. They all put a price on pollution (for example, see carbon price), and so provide an economic incentive to reduce pollution beginning with the lowest-cost opportunities. Economists have different views over the cost estimates of climate change mitigation given in the Review.

Emissions trading (also known as cap and trade) is a market-based approach to controlling pollution by providing economic incentives for achieving reductions in the emissions of pollutants. On the other hand, an extensive historical analysis of technological efficiency improvements has conclusively shown that improvements in the efficiency of the use of energy and materials were almost always outpaced by economic growth, in large part because of the rebound effect (conservation) or Jevons Paradox resulting in a net increase in resource use and associated pollution. In its book, the Commission described four key elements of sustainability with respect to energy: the ability to increase the supply of energy to meet growing human needs, energy efficiency and conservation, public health and safety, and \"protection of the biosphere and prevention of more localized forms of pollution.\" Urbanization creates enormous social, economic and environmental changes, which provide an opportunity for sustainability with the \"potential to use resources more efficiently, to create more sustainable land use and to protect the biodiversity"

Despite this, Jupiter still radiates more heat than it receives from the Sun; the amount of heat produced inside it is similar to the total solar radiation it receives. The water clouds are assumed to generate thunderstorms in the same way as terrestrial thunderstorms, driven by the heat rising from the interior. Jupiter's low axial tilt means that the poles constantly receive less solar radiation than at the planet's equatorial region. Convection within the interior of the planet transports more energy to the poles, balancing out the temperatures at the cloud layer. As with Uranus, the source of this heating is unknown, but the discrepancy is larger: Uranus only radiates 1.1 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun; whereas Neptune radiates about 2.61 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun.

Collaboration with global organizations can help secure funding and coordinate efforts across regions, ensuring a unified approach to tackling this issue. These dangerous pollutants are known as the criteria pollutants, and include ozone, particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and lead. Pollutants emitted into the atmosphere by human activity include: Carbon dioxide (CO 2) \u2013 Because of its role as a greenhouse gas it has been described as \"the leading pollutant\" and \"the worst climate pollutant\". In these modern designs, pollution from coal-fired power plants comes from the emission of gases such as carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur dioxide into the air, as well a significant volume of wastewater which may contain lead, mercury, cadmium and chromium, as well as arsenic, selenium and nitrogen compounds (nitrates and nitrites). Flue gas from combustion of the fossil fuels contains carbon dioxide and water vapor, as well as pollutants such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), and, for coal-fired plants, mercury, traces of other metals, and fly ash. Common gaseous pollutants include carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and nitrogen oxides produced by industry and motor vehicles. This strategy aims to reduce pollution while promoting sustainable practices."

        "approach": "To address once natural influences, in particular the impact of el ni\u00f1o and la ni\u00f1a, are removed from the recent termperature record, there is no evidence of a significant change in the human contribution to climate change., the following approach can be implemented: 1. Develop policies to protect ecosystems, such as establishing protected areas and regulating resource extraction. 2. Promote sustainable practices among communities through education and incentives. 3. Invest in research to better understand the issue and develop innovative solutions. 4. Foster international cooperation to address global aspects of the problem. Climate change means a change of climate which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and which is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods. The ENSO cycle, including both El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a, causes global changes in temperature and rainfall. Scientists have determined that the major factors causing the current climate change are greenhouse gases, land use changes, and aerosols and soot. The introduction includes this statement: There is strong evidence that the warming of the Earth over the last half-century has been caused largely by human activity, such as the burning of fossil fuels and changes in land use, including agriculture and deforestation. While \u2018climate change\u2019 can be due to natural forces or human activity, there is now substantial evidence to indicate that human activity \u2013 and specifically increased greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions \u2013 is a key factor in the pace and extent of global temperature increases. This approach seeks to balance environmental protection with sustainable development, ensuring long-term benefits for both nature and society."

Foster international cooperation to address global aspects of the problem. As a result of the state's strong environmental movement, California has some of the most aggressive renewable energy goals in the United States, with a target for California to obtain a third of its electricity from renewables by 2020. It would be possible to convert the total supply to 100% renewable energy, including heating, cooling and mobility, by 2050. The strong economic growth helped the government to reduce the government debt as a percentage of GDP and Spain's high unemployment rate began to steadily decline. What the programme failed to do, the sharp and prolonged economic crisis has done from 2010 to 2011 in that tens of thousands of immigrants have left the country due to lack of jobs. It brought high unemployment (which has been decreasing but remains above pre-recession levels), along with low consumer confidence, the continuing decline in home values and increase in foreclosures and personal bankruptcies, an escalating federal debt crisis, inflation, and rising petroleum and food prices. This approach seeks to balance environmental protection with sustainable development, ensuring long-term benefits for both nature and society."

Foster international cooperation to address global aspects of the problem. By addressing climate change, we can avoid the costs associated with the effects of climate change. \"Costing Climate Change\". It would be cheaper, they say, to wait for the impacts of climate change and then adapt to them\" says writer and environmental activist George Monbiot in an article addressing the supposed economic hazards of addressing climate change. He also states that, \"Any conceivable emissions reductions policies, even if successful, cannot have a perceptible impact on the climate for many decades\", and from this he concludes that, \"In coming decades the only policies that can effectively be used to manage the immediate effects of climate variability and change will be adaptive.\" Further global climate changes are predicted, with impacts expected to become more costly as time progresses. This approach seeks to balance environmental protection with sustainable development, ensuring long-term benefits for both nature and society."

        "approach": "To address the issue of in those days you couldn\u2019t have seen across the street for all the carbon emissions and the crap coming out of the chimneys.', a multi-step strategy can be implemented: 1. Promote renewable energy adoption by offering incentives such as tax credits for solar and wind energy installations. 2. Expand public transportation systems to reduce reliance on fossil fuel-based vehicles, especially in urban areas. 3. Implement stricter regulations on industrial emissions, requiring companies to adopt cleaner technologies and report emissions annually. Additionally, public awareness campaigns can educate communities about sustainable practices, such as reducing energy consumption and supporting green policies. International collaboration with organizations like the UN can help secure funding and coordinate efforts across countries, ensuring a unified approach to tackling this issue. Smoke and carbon monoxide from wildfires. Carbon monoxide poisoning and fatalities are often caused by faulty vents and chimneys, or by the burning of charcoal indoors or in a confined space, such as a tent. \"The Worst Climate Pollution Is Carbon Dioxide\". Global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in 2010 were equivalent to 49 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide (using the most recent global warming potentials over 100 years from the AR5 report). Average carbon emissions within the haulage industry are falling\u2014in the thirty-year period from 1977 to 2007, the carbon emissions associated with a 200-mile journey fell by 21 percent; NOx emissions are also down 87 percent, whereas journey times have fallen by around a third. This approach aims to mitigate the environmental impact while fostering long-term sustainability."

Foster international cooperation to address global aspects of the problem. According to Wilson, \"Wobbles in the orbit of Mars are the main cause of its climate change in the current era\" (see also orbital forcing). Henrik Svensmark has suggested that the magnetic activity of the sun deflects cosmic rays, and that this may influence the generation of cloud condensation nuclei, and thereby have an effect on the climate. Some of the main human activities that contribute to global warming are: increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, for a warming effect global changes to land surface, such as deforestation, for a warming effect increasing atmospheric concentrations of aerosols, mainly for a cooling effect In addition to human activities, some natural mechanisms can also cause climate change, including for example, climate oscillations, changes in solar activity, and volcanic activity. \"The main cause of climate change during the last millennia is the corresponding cyclic variation of the 80- and 200-year component of irradiance correlated with activity. At the center, the temperature may be up to 6,000\u00a0\u00b0C (10,830\u00a0\u00b0F), and the pressure could reach 360\u00a0GPa (52\u00a0million\u00a0psi).
